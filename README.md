# Virtual Diva - Your Personal Desktop Assistant!
## How to use?
Set an image folder path (Default is 1.jpg from the assets folder) 

Hold shift + mouse[0] for the right eye and shift+mouse[2] for the left eye and you're done! 

## Dependencies
Python and PyGame
### How to install pygame?
Open cmd and type
`pip install pygame`

## Recent changes:
Just added the whole thing
## Things I'm working on
Some actual movement, wobbling, vtuber model support, will probably completely scrach the code to not use PyGame because it's not really efficient for this kind of a thing(probably...)
## Author notes
I just did this for fun, I always dream of making a virtual desktop pet that could actually be considered your second friend, interact with your computer etc...

This is just a fun beggining and maybe we'll (as in me) get there some day!
